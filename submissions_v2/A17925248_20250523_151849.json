  "detailed_ai_evaluation": "**1. Architect Selection & Scope**\n\nYour choice of Kazuyo Sejima is entirely appropriate for this assignment.  The extracted text clearly indicates a focus on her biography, architectural style, and key works. The scope is well-defined from the outset, focusing on a comprehensive overview of her career and significant buildings. Score: 5/5\n\n\n**2. Organization & Document Setup**\n\nBased on the provided image of the first page, the document's organization appears logical and well-structured.  A Table of Contents is promised and the text shows clear section headings.  The inclusion of a student bio and photo on the first page is also a good starting point.  However, I cannot fully assess the overall organization without seeing additional pages, especially the actual Table of Contents. Score: 4/5\n\n\n**3. Biographical Content**\n\nYour biography of Kazuyo Sejima is well-written and comprehensive, covering key aspects of her life and career.  While I cannot definitively assess the exact word count from the provided extract, the provided sections on her education, early career, partnership with Nishizawa, architectural philosophy, and major works indicate a substantial effort to meet the word count requirement (750+ words).  Score: 4/5\n\n\n**4. Citation of Architect Bio**\n\nYou have included a list of references.  While I cannot definitively assess the complete APA formatting from the provided extract, most entries appear to align with a professional citation style. The inclusion of DOIs where available suggests a strong commitment to academic rigor. The number of references appears to comfortably exceed the minimum requirement of five. Score: 4/5\n\n\n**5. Selection & Quality of Images**\n\nThe selected images are of generally good quality and clearly illustrate several of Sejima's buildings.  Resolutions appear sufficient for online presentation.  However, judging from the sample images, the quantity of images might need a review to ensure you meet any specified guidelines for interior and exterior shots per building.  Score: 4/5\n\n\n**6. Image Citation & Attribution**\n\nAll selected images have clear and consistent source attributions using hyperlinks, which is appropriate for a digital document. The format is consistent, making it easy to verify the sources. Score: 5/5\n\n\n**7. Coverage of 10 Famous Buildings**\n\nThe provided text covers more than 10 of Sejima’s significant buildings, which exceeds the requirements.  Each building's entry includes its name, location, and a brief description of its significance.  The association with the images is clear through links and visual confirmation in the selected pages. Score: 5/5\n\n\n**8. Image Relevance**\n\nThe images visible in the selected pages are directly relevant to the text, clearly illustrating the discussed buildings and architectural features. The visual information complements the written content effectively. Score: 5/5\n\n\n**9. Personal Bio & Photo**\n\nYour personal bio is succinct and appropriately placed.
